These build books are shared for informational purposes only and reflect just one possible approach based on specific assumptions, environments, and versions at a single point in time. If anything documented here appears unclear, questionable, or unsuitable for your situation, stop now and proceed no further.

It is assumed you will backup all important, relevant, and valuable data and systems before beginning, and that you will follow all industry best practices to protect yours or anyone's data, infrastructure, and credentials.
