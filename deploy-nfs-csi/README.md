# NFS Server and Kubernetes Persistent Storage Notes

Herein contains example commands and instructions as reference for installing, configuring, and validating an NFS server on Rocky Linux, along with integrating such NFS storage into a Kubernetes cluster.  The NFS CSI driver is used for helping to persistenting data, and the intent of this guidance is to share an easy and practical approach for enabling shared, persistent volumes in Kubernetes, supported by NFS.
